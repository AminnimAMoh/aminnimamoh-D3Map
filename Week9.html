				<p>Modernizing the world during the past century resulted in emitting a significant amount of heat-trapping gasses.
					<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-overview/">(Nunez, 2019).</a>
					The activities such as power production and on-road vehicles are some ongoing source of these gasses.
					The researches are evident that levels of greenhouse gasses are higher in the present day than at any time during the last 800,000 years.
					<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-overview/">(Nunez, 2019).</a>
					Due to this fact, Global warming effects are becoming more and more evident year after year.
					This trend has been influencing many factors of the planet earth nature namely, the glaciers are melting, and sea levels are rising.
					<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-overview/">(Nunez, 2019).</a>
					Regarding the UN Environment Program, the higher sea level and the higher temperature increases the chance of evaporation
					and cloud formation. Following that, the air has more potential to hold more moisture in higher temperatures.
					<a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/how-climate-change-making-record-breaking-floods-new-normal">(UN Environment Program, 2020).</a>
					These changes can increase precipitation intensity, duration, and/or frequency.

				<h3>Our Vision</h3>
				<p>The focus of this research is on Bangladesh and the severity of its natural disasters.
					Bangladesh is one of the many countries built very close to the sea. Some of the coastal cities of Bangladesh are built lands with less than 10 miters.
					<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/sea-levels-rise-bangladeshi-islanders-must-decide-between-keeping-water-out-or-letting">(Cornwall, 2018).</a></p>
				<h3>Data</h3>
				<p>This visualisation involves two main sets of data, natural disaster levels and population which
					would be displayed according to each district. We collected data of Bangladesh’s monthly rainfall data from 1948-2014.</p>
				<h3>Findings</h3>
				<p>With our visualisation we aimed to provide information on Bangladesh’s extreme weather and how that influences migration between cities over time.
					Not only does it affect migration but we also hope to highlight how other than economic issues, natural disasters is a major factor to Bangladesh’s
					slum population and issues. We also hope that this data can help discover any patterns according to the weather and which areas are less prone to
					extreme rainfall in hopes to solve slum issues and reduce the risk of Bangladeshi people going into slums and poverty.</p>
