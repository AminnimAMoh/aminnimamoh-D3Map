			<p class="UNI-discription">This project has facilitated as an assignment
				for course Information Visualization from Architecture and Design planning faculty of the University of Sydney. </p>
			<div class="paragraph-container">

				<p>This project is programmed in D3.js which is a very powerful JavaScript library for visualizing data sets and data mining.</p>

				<p>The focus of this research is on Bangladesh and the severity of its natural disasters.
					Bangladesh is one of the many countries built very close to the sea. Some of the coastal
					cities of Bangladesh are built on lands with less than 10 miters high from the sea level.
					<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/sea-levels-rise-bangladeshi-islanders-must-decide-between-keeping-water-out-or-letting">(Cornwall, 2018).</a>.
					this fact has increased the level of vulnerability of these cities against
					the extreme climate change resulted from Global Warming.</p>

				<p>Modernizing the world during the past century has resulted in the emission of a significant
					amount of heat-trapping gasses.
					<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-overview/">(Nunez, 2019).</a>
					. Activities such as power production and on-road
					vehicles are some of the ongoing sources of these gasses. From current research, it is evident
					that levels of greenhouse gasses are higher in the present day than at any time during the
					last 800,000 years.
					<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-overview/">(Nunez, 2019).</a>
					Due to this fact, Global warming effects are becoming
					more and more evident year after year. This trend has been influencing many factors of
					planet earth’s nature namely, the glaciers are melting, and sea levels are rising.
					<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-overview/">(Nunez, 2019).</a>
					The UN Environment Program advises that the higher sea level and the
					higher temperatures increase the chance of evaporation and cloud formation. Following
					that, the air has more potential to hold more moisture in higher temperatures.
					<a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/how-climate-change-making-record-breaking-floods-new-normal">(UN Environment Program, 2020).</a>
					These changes can increase precipitation intensity,
					duration, and/or frequency.</p>

				<p>With our visualization, we aimed to provide information on Bangladesh’s extreme weather
					and how that influences migration between cities over time. Not only does it affect
					migration, but we also hope to highlight how other than economic issues, natural
					disasters are a major factor in Bangladesh’s slum population and issues. We also hope
					that this data can help discover any patterns according to the weather and which areas
					are less prone to extreme rainfall in hopes to solve slum issues and reduce the risk of
					Bangladeshi people going into slums and poverty.</p>

				<p>In this project, we are using the Bangladesh rainfall data set between 1948-2014.
					Using this data set we have visualized the amount of rainfall of each data recording
					station by the size of circles positioned at the geolocation of that station. This can
					be a good approach to show an overview of the year's rainfall during the selected year.
					We have specifically used five years regarding the three years of population change data
					available. The population data were available to use include 1991, 2001, and 2011. Users
					can select the years placed on top of the map and the information of the rainfall instantly
					on the map. To show the change in the results we have animated the stations' circles by
					adding transitions to the radius of the elements.</p>

				<p style="margin-top:55px;">Secondly, the user interface allows the user to hover over any station, and by clicking
					they can study-specific information about that station. This information is presented in
					four graphs around the selected station. The spider graph placed on top shows the amount
					of rain during each month of the selected year of the selected city. This graph also is
					intractable by hovering over the points on the graph. In this interaction, the user
					can see the exact amount of rainfall during that month in millimeters. Other three
					graphs showing an overview of all cities of the country laid out from small to large.
					Also, the population of the selected city is highlighted in red. This allows the user
					to compeer three years of the population between three years.</p>
