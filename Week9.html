				<p>Modernizing the world during the past century resulted in emitting a significant amount of heat-trapping gasses.
					<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-overview/">(Nunez, 2019).</a>
					The activities such as power production and on-road vehicles are some ongoing source of these gasses.
					The researches are evident that levels of greenhouse gasses are higher in the present day than at any time during the last 800,000 years.
					<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-overview/">(Nunez, 2019).</a>
					Due to this fact, Global warming effects are becoming more and more evident year after year.
					This trend has been influencing many factors of the planet earth nature namely, the glaciers are melting, and sea levels are rising.
					<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-overview/">(Nunez, 2019).</a>
					Regarding the UN Environment Program, the higher sea level and the higher temperature increases the chance of evaporation
					and cloud formation. Following that, the air has more potential to hold more moisture in higher temperatures.

					These changes can increase precipitation intensity, duration, and/or frequency.
